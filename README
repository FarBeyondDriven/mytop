ABOUT

  mytop is a `top' clone for MySQL

  mytop is a console-based (non-gui) tool for monitoring the threads
  and overall performance of MySQL 3.22.x, 3.23.x, and 4.x servers. It
  runs on most Unix systems which have Perl, DBI, and Term::ReadKey
  installed. And with Term::ANSIColor installed you even get color. As
  of version 0.7, it even runs on Windows (somewhat).

INSTALLATION

  tar -zxvf mytop-<version>.tar.gz
  cd mytop-<version>
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

  The test is a bit stupid, but it's there from completeness.

DOCUMENTATION

  man mytop
